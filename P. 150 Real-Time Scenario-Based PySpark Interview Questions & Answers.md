# Real-Time Scenario-Based PySpark Interview Questions & Answers

### üßë‚Äçüíª Data Ingestion & Processing

**1. How did you handle schema evolution in PySpark when reading data from Snowflake or S3?**
Schema evolution is handled using the `mergeSchema` option (for formats like Parquet). In Snowflake, we dynamically infer schema and use external metadata tables to map and adjust columns. We also write code to detect new columns and add default values during transformation.

**2. What would you do if one API out of 10 fails in a data pipeline?**
We implement try-except blocks around each API call and use logging to capture failures. Failed APIs are added to a retry queue. We also design the DAG to be idempotent so re-running only retries the failed API.

**3. How do you read large files from S3 in chunks using PySpark?**
We partition large files either by time-based folders or split them using S3 Select or pre-processing jobs. PySpark reads in parallel using `.read.format().load()` and we tune the number of partitions using `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`.

**4. Explain how you created dynamic partitioning while writing data to S3.**
We use `partitionBy("column_name")` while writing DataFrames. For dynamic partitions, we extract the partition columns at runtime based on file content.

**5. How do you validate the structure and content of incoming data files before processing?**
We implement schema validation using StructType. We validate row counts, nulls, duplicates, and date formats before transformation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è PySpark Performance Tuning

**6. How did you identify a slow PySpark job in production and what steps did you take to optimize it?**
We used Spark UI to identify long stages and wide transformations. After identifying shuffle-heavy operations, we introduced broadcast joins, tuned partition counts, and cached intermediate DataFrames.

**7. What is data skew, and how have you resolved it in your project?**
Data skew is when one key has significantly more records, leading to unbalanced tasks. We resolved it using salting, i.e., adding a random number to the skewed key to distribute data evenly.

**8. Describe a situation where repartitioning or coalescing made a difference in job performance.**
In one case, 200 partitions were generated by default, slowing down small-file writes. We used `.coalesce(20)` to reduce the overhead.

**9. Have you used broadcast joins in a production scenario? When and why?**
Yes, when joining a large dataset with a small lookup table (<10MB). Broadcasting avoided shuffle and sped up the join operation.

**10. How do you monitor Spark job performance on EMR?**
We use Spark UI, Ganglia, CloudWatch, and EMR job history logs to monitor job runtime, memory usage, GC, and failed tasks.

---

### üíß PySpark Transformations & ETL Logic

**11. How did you implement complex joins and aggregations in PySpark efficiently?**
We used broadcast joins where applicable, cached intermediate DataFrames, and ensured columns were indexed properly using `.select()` to reduce shuffles.

**12. Explain a real-life use case where you had to unnest deeply nested JSON.**
We processed REST API responses with nested arrays. We used `explode()` and `withColumn()` to flatten nested structures and extracted key-value pairs recursively.

**13. How did you create a PySpark pipeline to process data from multiple sources like APIs and databases?**
We used Python requests to pull from APIs, JDBC to read from DBs, and Spark transformations to normalize and merge the data.

**14. Share a scenario where you used window functions to solve a business problem.**
In a churn analysis, we used `row_number()` to rank the latest transactions per customer and `lag()` to compare activities across time.

**15. How do you track and handle duplicate records during ETL processing?**
We use `dropDuplicates()` or window functions with `row_number()` to retain the latest record. We also log duplicates for analysis.

---

### üß† Error Handling & Debugging

**16. What kind of exceptions have you commonly faced in PySpark jobs and how did you fix them?**
Common errors include schema mismatches, null pointer exceptions, and out-of-memory errors. We add extensive logging, null checks, and use `try-except` blocks.

**17. How do you implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs in Airflow?**
We configure retries in DAG definition (`retries=3`, `retry_delay=5min`). We also use alerting with Slack/Email.

**18. Share a scenario where Spark UI helped you debug a failing job.**
In one job, long GC times were visible in Spark UI. We increased executor memory and tuned GC settings to fix it.

**19. How do you capture bad records or corrupt files while reading large datasets?**
We use `badRecordsPath` for CSV/JSON and parse data in try-except blocks for custom formats. Invalid records are logged separately.

**20. What are some logging strategies you follow for PySpark code in production?**
We use `log4j` for structured logging and external logging tools like CloudWatch. Logs are structured with job ID, step name, and timestamp.

# Real-Time PySpark Interview Scenarios and Answers

---

### **21. How do you handle schema evolution in PySpark when reading from a data source like Parquet or Snowflake?**

**Answer:** PySpark allows schema evolution using options like `mergeSchema` when reading Parquet files. For example:

```python
spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("path")
```

For Snowflake, we often retrieve the latest schema by querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and dynamically constructing a DataFrame schema. Alternatively, we use Delta Lake with schema evolution enabled.

---

* Also use `SecretsManager` for credentials in AWS-based environments.

---

### **27. Give an example of how you dealt with skewed data in PySpark joins.**

**Answer:**

* Identified skew using key distribution metrics.
* Introduced **salting**: modified keys on one side (e.g., add random suffix) and exploded keys on the other side to match.
* Used **broadcast joins** if one table was small.
* Applied `repartition()` before the join to ensure better distribution.

---

### **28. What is your approach when your PySpark job is consuming too much memory?**

**Answer:**

* Repartitioned data to reduce size per partition.
* Used narrow transformations instead of wide ones.
* Tuned `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.cores`, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.
* Used `persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)` to offload from memory.

---

### **29. How do you handle late arriving data or backfills in a streaming pipeline?**

**Answer:**

* Used **watermarking** with event time in Structured Streaming:

```python
.withWatermark("event_time", "1 hour")
```

* Handled late events in downstream logic.
* For backfills, triggered batch jobs with past data range and separate S3 path.

---

### **30. Describe a scenario where you needed to ensure idempotency in your PySpark job.**

**Answer:**

* Idempotency was critical while writing output to S3 or Snowflake.
* Achieved it by using `overwrite` mode and **partitioned output** (e.g., by date).
* Used job run identifiers or timestamps to separate directories.
* Maintained audit logs in a control table to track processed data.

---

### **31. How do you handle missing or null values in PySpark DataFrames?**

**Answer:**

Handling nulls depends on context:

* **Drop rows with nulls:**

  ```python
  df.na.drop()
  ```

  Options:

  * `df.na.drop(how="any")` ‚Äì drop if any column has null
  * `df.na.drop(how="all")` ‚Äì drop only if all columns are null

* **Fill nulls with default values:**

  ```python
  df.na.fill({"age": 0, "name": "unknown"})
  ```

* **Filter out nulls explicitly:**

  ```python
  df.filter(df["age"].isNotNull())
  ```

Use method based on business logic (e.g., for ML pipelines, fill with mean/median using `imputer`).

---

### **32. How do you optimize PySpark joins in real-time pipelines?**

**Answer:**

Optimization techniques:

* **Broadcast smaller table:**

  ```python
  from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
  df1.join(broadcast(df2), "id")
  ```

* **Repartition by join key to reduce shuffle:**

  ```python
  df1.repartition("id").join(df2.repartition("id"), "id")
  ```

* **Avoid skewed joins (use salting):** Add/mod hash key to balance partition sizes.

* **Use appropriate join type (e.g., avoid full outer joins unless necessary).**

* Enable join hints if supported:

  ```python
  df1.join(df2.hint("broadcast"), "id")
  ```

---

### **33. How do you debug job failure in EMR while running a PySpark job?**

**Answer:**

Steps:

* **Check Spark UI:** Look for stages, DAGs, and failed task logs.

  * Missing files/schemas ‚Üí validate paths and schema before execution

---

### **34. What is the use of `.persist()` vs `.cache()` in a real job?**

**Answer:**

* `.cache()` is a shortcut for `.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)`.
* Use **`.persist()`** when you want control over storage level (e.g., disk-only, off-heap).
* Use **`.cache()`** when RDD/DataFrame is used multiple times and fits in memory.
* Helps in iterative algorithms (ML, graph).

```python
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
```

---

### **35. How do you test PySpark code locally before deployment?**

**Answer:**

* Use **`local[*]` mode** for SparkSession:

  ```python
  spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]").appName("test").getOrCreate()
  ```

* Use **pytest** or **unittest** with:

  * Temporary DataFrames
  * Sample input files in `/tmp`
  * Mocking APIs/snowflake with `responses` or test doubles

* Leverage `.collect()` and `.show()` for validation

---

### **36. How do you manage schema evolution in real-time pipelines (e.g., Snowflake source)?**

**Answer:**

* Use **schema inference** carefully ‚Äî schema drift can break ETL.
* Strategy:

  * Read schema separately via sampling
  * Validate new schema using `.schema.json()`
  * Write schema comparison logic
  * Add new columns as nullable or handle using `selectExpr` with `IF EXISTS`

Tools:

* Delta Lake schema evolution (`mergeSchema`)
* Glue Schema Registry for tracking

---

### **37. Have you implemented dynamic partitioning in PySpark? How?**

**Answer:**

Yes. To enable dynamic partitioning:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode", "dynamic")
df.write.partitionBy("year", "month").mode("overwrite").parquet("s3://bucket/output/")
```

* It partitions by `year` and `month` dynamically
* Helps reduce scan space for queries (e.g., Athena, Hive)

---

### **38. How do you integrate external APIs into your PySpark job?**

**Answer:**

* Use Python‚Äôs `requests` or `httpx` inside UDFs **with caution** (not recommended for heavy API calls).

Best practice:

* **Extract API data separately** via:

  * Standalone Python script using `requests`
  * Save API data as JSON/CSV to S3
  * Ingest using PySpark `spark.read.json("s3://...")`

Reason:

* Spark isn‚Äôt meant for row-wise API I/O ‚Äì it slows down massively.

---

### **39. What‚Äôs your approach to version-controlling PySpark jobs?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Git** to maintain:

  * PySpark job scripts
  * Config files (YAML/JSON for param settings)
  * Airflow DAGs
* Use branches for feature and hotfixes
* Enforce PRs with code review
* Use `.gitignore` for logs, `__pycache__`, temp data
* Store job artifacts (egg/whl) for CI/CD pipelines

---

### **40. How do you monitor your PySpark jobs in production?**

**Answer:**

* **Monitoring Tools:**

  * **Spark UI** for execution details
  * **CloudWatch (AWS)** for EMR cluster resource metrics
  * **Ganglia** / **Prometheus + Grafana**
  * **Airflow UI** for DAG and task status
* Log all:

  * Data stats (record count, nulls)
  * Execution time
  * Error stack traces

Use logging libraries:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

### **41. How do you handle large file ingestion (100+ GB) efficiently in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Handling large files in PySpark:

* **Use partitioning:**

  ```python
  df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv("s3://bucket/largefile/", multiLine=True)
  df = df.repartition(100)
  ```

  Increases parallelism and reduces shuffle.

* **Use appropriate file format:** Prefer **Parquet** or **ORC** over CSV/JSON for columnar compression.

* **Enable predicate pushdown**:

  ```python
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown", "true")
  ```

* **Tune Spark config:** Use `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.

---

### **42. What are common causes of memory issues in PySpark jobs?**

**Answer:**

* **Too much data in a single partition** (data skew)
* **Caching huge DataFrames** without enough memory
* **Improper joins** (e.g., wide join + no broadcast)
* **Expensive UDFs** that create high GC overhead
* **No checkpointing** in iterative jobs (e.g., ML)
* **Unbounded data growth** due to unfiltered joins or aggregations

**Fixes:**

* Repartition/coalesce
* Use broadcast join
* Avoid unnecessary `.collect()` or `.cache()`
* Increase executor memory or use auto-scaling on EMR

---

### **43. Explain your deployment process for PySpark jobs.**

**Answer:**

---

### **44. How do you implement SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Two types handled commonly:

* **SCD Type 1 (overwrite):**

  * Just overwrite old record with new

  ```python
  df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("dim_table")
  ```

* **SCD Type 2 (history tracking):**

  * Add new record with `current_flag`, `effective_date`, `expiry_date`
  * Use `window` and `when` to close old records:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.window import Window
    from pyspark.sql.functions import when, col, lead

    w = Window.partitionBy("id").orderBy("effective_date")
    df = df.withColumn("expiry_date", lead("effective_date").over(w))
    ```

---

### **45. How do you build reusable code for PySpark projects?**

      return df.withColumn("name", upper(col("name")))
  ```

* Import in jobs:

  ```python
  from transformations import clean_names
  ```

* Store configs in YAML/JSON and parse in jobs

---

### **46. How do you secure secrets (like API keys or DB credentials) in PySpark workflows?**

**Answer:**

Best practices:

* **Use AWS Secrets Manager** or environment variables
* Use Airflow‚Äôs `Variable` or `Connections` feature
* Avoid hardcoding in scripts

Example:

```python
import boto3, json
secrets = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
secret_val = secrets.get_secret_value(SecretId="snowflake_conn")["SecretString"]
credentials = json.loads(secret_val)
```

---

### **47. How do you perform job retries for failures in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Two ways:

* **Within PySpark using try-except + retry logic:**

  ```python
  for _ in range(3):
      try:
          run_my_job()
          break
      except Exception as e:
          print("Retrying...", e)
  ```

* **External orchestration tools (Airflow)**: Use `retries` parameter:

  ```python
  BashOperator(task_id='spark_job', retries=3, retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5))
  ```

---

### **48. Explain how you handled schema mismatch while reading data.**

**Answer:**

Schema mismatch scenarios:

* **Extra/missing columns:** Use `schema` parameter to enforce expected structure
* **Different column types:** Use `cast()` or `selectExpr()`

Preventive approach:

```python
schema = StructType([...])
df = spark.read.schema(schema).csv("path")
```

Use `badRecordsPath` to isolate failures:

```python
.option("badRecordsPath", "s3://bucket/badrecords/")
```

---

### **51. How do you handle null or missing values in PySpark DataFrames?**

**Answer:**

PySpark provides multiple ways:

* **Drop nulls**:

  ```python
  df.dropna()  # drops rows with any null
  df.dropna(how='all')  # drops rows only if all are null
  ```

* **Fill nulls**:

  ```python
  df.fillna({'age': 0, 'name': 'unknown'})
  ```

* **Filter out**:

  ```python
  df.filter(df['column'].isNotNull())
  ```

* **Impute (MLlib)**:

  ```python
  from pyspark.ml.feature import Imputer
  imputer = Imputer(inputCols=['age'], outputCols=['age_filled']).setStrategy("mean")
  result = imputer.fit(df).transform(df)
  ```

---

### **52. How do you track lineage of transformations in PySpark?**

6. **Avoid wide transformations or caching huge DataFrames**
7. **Review UDFs** ‚Äì replace with native functions or `pandas_udf`
8. **Use `.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)`** instead of `.cache()` if large

---

### **54. How do you update specific rows in a DataFrame?**

**Answer:**

Since DataFrames are immutable, use `when()` and `otherwise()`:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import when

df = df.withColumn(
    "salary",
    when(df["department"] == "HR", df["salary"] * 1.1).otherwise(df["salary"])
)
```

For full-table updates (like in SCD), use overwrite or merge logic using Delta Lake or Snowflake.

---

### **61. How do you handle late-arriving data in a PySpark pipeline?**

**Answer:**

Late-arriving data refers to records that arrive after their expected processing window. You can handle it using:

* **Watermarking** (in Structured Streaming):

  ```python
  df_with_watermark = df.withWatermark("event_time", "10 minutes")
  ```

* **Partition overwrite**:

  * If data is daily partitioned, reprocess affected partitions (e.g., overwrite `"dt=2024-07-10"`).

* **Delta Lake Time Travel**:

  * Compare versions and reconcile late-arriving data.

* **Maintain a retry or correction pipeline**:

  * Trigger backfills when data is detected as delayed.

---

### **62. How do you maintain data consistency between multiple Spark jobs?**

**Answer:**

Best practices:

1. **Atomic writes** using overwrite or copy-on-write methods.
2. **Avoid overlapping job windows**.
3. Use **transactional tables** (like Delta Lake).
4. Employ **lock mechanisms** using a flag file or database lock table.
5. Implement **idempotent writes** to avoid duplicates:

   * Use `dropDuplicates` or insert-only-if-not-exist logic.

---

### **63. How do you ensure schema evolution is handled in your PySpark job?**

**Answer:**

* Use **schema merging** for formats like Parquet:

  ```python
  df = spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("s3://bucket/data")
  ```

* Define a **schema registry** or maintain expected schemas in JSON.

* On evolution:

  * Add new columns with default values
  * Use `.selectExpr()` to reorder columns if needed
  * Use tools like **AWS Glue Schema Registry** or **Confluent Schema Registry** for streaming

---

### **64. How do you debug out-of-memory (OOM) errors in EMR Spark jobs?**

**Answer:**

Steps:

1. **Check Spark UI** ‚Äì find stages with long GC or shuffle

2. Increase memory:

   ```bash
   --executor-memory 8G --driver-memory 4G
   ```

3. **Use `persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)`** to avoid filling RAM

4. **Avoid wide transformations** like groupByKey

5. **Reduce parallelism** or increase partitions

6. Enable GC logging for investigation

---

### **65. What is the best way to deal with skewed joins in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

* **Broadcast small table**:

  ```python
  df1.join(broadcast(df2), "id")
  ```

* **Salting technique**:

  ```python
  from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, concat
  skewed_df = df.withColumn("salt", (rand()*10).cast("int"))
  ```

* **Repartition before join**:

  ```python
  df.repartition("id")
  ```

* **Use bucketing** or partitioning at source

---

### **66. How do you run multiple PySpark jobs in parallel?**

**Answer:**

* **From Airflow** ‚Äì define parallel DAG branches

* **Using Threads/Process in Python** (less preferred):

  ```python
  from threading import Thread
  Thread(target=job1).start()
  ```

    .union(json_df.select("id", "name", "age")) \
    .union(parquet_df.select("id", "name", "age"))
```

üëâ Use `select()` or `withColumn()` to align column names and data types.

---

### **82. What is a skewed join and how do you resolve it in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

A **skewed join** happens when one key has **disproportionately high records**, causing one executor to do most of the work.

**Solution**:

* **Salting technique**:
  Add a random prefix or suffix to keys:

  ```python
  from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, concat_ws
  df1 = df1.withColumn("join_key_salted", concat_ws("_", df1["join_key"], (rand()*10).cast("int")))
  df2 = df2.withColumn("join_key_salted", concat_ws("_", df2["join_key"], lit("0")))  # Replicate for all
  ```

* Or use:

  * **Broadcast join** for small tables
  * **Repartitioning** before join

---

### **83. How do you ensure data quality before writing into a target?**

**Answer:**

Use these steps:

    return df.withColumn("name", upper(col("name"))) \
             .withColumn("is_valid", when(col("age") > 0, True).otherwise(False))
```

Usage:

```python
df_cleaned = clean_customer_data(df)
```

Reusable for testing, modular pipelines, and parameterization.

---

### **85. How do you deal with corrupt or malformed records while reading data in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Set **read modes**:

```python
df = spark.read.option("mode", "PERMISSIVE").json("path/")
```

Modes:

* `"PERMISSIVE"` ‚Äì corrupt records go to `_corrupt_record` column
* `"DROPMALFORMED"` ‚Äì drops bad records
* `"FAILFAST"` ‚Äì throws an error

Use `badRecordsPath` to store rejected rows for debugging:

```python
.option("badRecordsPath", "s3://bucket/errors/")
```

               .option("columnNameOfCorruptRecord", "_corrupt_record") \
               .csv("input_data.csv")
```

**Modes available:**

* `PERMISSIVE` (default): keeps corrupted records in a separate column
* `DROPMALFORMED`: skips corrupted records
* `FAILFAST`: fails the job on encountering bad data

---

### **102. What is salting and when do you use it in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

**Salting** is used to handle **data skew** during joins or aggregations when one key has disproportionately more data.

**Example:**
If key `India` has 80% of records, join will skew.

**Fix:**

1. Add random salt key:

   ```python
   df1 = df1.withColumn("salt", expr("floor(rand() * 10)"))
   ```

2. Duplicate small dataset with same salt values.

3. Join on key + salt.

Use chained `when()` and logical operators:

```python
df.filter(
    (col("age") > 18) &
    (col("country") == "India") |
    (col("score") > 80)
)
```

Or using `expr()` for SQL-like syntax:

```python
df.filter(expr("age > 18 AND (country = 'India' OR score > 80)"))
```

---

### **110. What is the use of `explain()` in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

`explain()` prints the **logical and physical execution plan** of a DataFrame.

### **111. How do you handle schema evolution in PySpark, especially with Parquet or Snowflake data sources?**

**Answer:**

**Schema evolution** means allowing changes in schema (new columns, type changes) without breaking jobs.

In **Parquet**, enable:

```python
df = spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("path")
```

For **Snowflake**, handle using:

* SELECT specific known columns
* Use **`inferSchema`**, or explicitly define schema
* For unknown columns: load to `Row`, or infer schema dynamically using Pandas

In PySpark jobs:

* Use `StructType` with nullable=True
* Add versioning logic if schema drift is frequent

---

### **112. What‚Äôs the difference between `coalesce()` and `repartition()`?**

| Feature        | `coalesce(n)`                   | `repartition(n)`              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Shuffles data? | ‚ùå No (narrow transformation)    | ‚úÖ Yes (wide transformation)   |
| When to use    | Reduce number of partitions     | Increase number of partitions |
| Performance    | Faster for shrinking partitions | Better for load balancing     |
| Example        | `df.coalesce(2)`                | `df.repartition(10)`          |

Use **`coalesce()`** when decreasing partitions and **`repartition()`** when increasing or rebalancing partitions.

---

### **113. What are window functions in PySpark? Give an example.**

**Answer:**

Window functions perform **calculations across rows related to the current row** (e.g., rank, lag).

Example:

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number

window_spec = Window.partitionBy("dept").orderBy("salary")
df.withColumn("rank", row_number().over(window_spec)).show()
```

Common functions:

* `row_number()`
* `rank()`
* `dense_rank()`
* `lag()`, `lead()`

---

### **114. How do you write a PySpark DataFrame to partitioned files in S3?**

**Answer:**

Use `.partitionBy()` during write:

```python
df.write.partitionBy("country", "year").parquet("s3a://bucket/output/")
```

It will create:

```
s3a://bucket/output/country=India/year=2023/...
```

Useful for Athena/Presto queries and optimized scans.

---

### **115. How do you optimize performance when working with very large DataFrames?**

**Answer:**

* **Persist() or cache()** to avoid recomputation
* Use **broadcast joins** for small lookup tables
* Avoid **wide transformations** (e.g., groupByKey)
* Use **repartition()** for better parallelism
* Push filters early (`filter()` before `join`)
* **Use DataFrame APIs**, not RDDs
* Enable **predicate and column pruning**

---

### **116. Explain how PySpark handles DAG and job stages.**

**Answer:**

PySpark builds a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** for every job:

* DAG shows **stages of transformations** and dependencies
* **Lazy evaluation** builds DAG but doesn‚Äôt run it
* When an **action** is triggered (e.g., `.collect()`), Spark:

  * Breaks DAG into **stages** (based on shuffles)
  * Launches **tasks** per partition in each stage
  * Executes stages in **topological order**

View DAG in Spark UI: `<driver-ip>:4040`

---

### **117. How do you implement slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2) in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Steps for SCD Type 2:

1. **Join** incoming data with historical table on business key
2. Identify **new and changed rows**
3. For changed rows:

   * **Expire** old record (set `end_date`)
   * **Insert** new record with `start_date`, `current_flag = Y`
4. For new rows: insert directly

Use `window` and `row_number()` to deduplicate.

---

### **118. Explain how checkpointing works in PySpark Streaming.**

**Answer:**

**Checkpointing** helps recover from failures by saving:

* Metadata (lineage info)
* Data (RDD contents, state)

In Structured Streaming:

```python
query = df.writeStream \
    .format("parquet") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint") \
    .start("/path/output/")
```

Required for:

* **Stateful operations**
* **Fault tolerance**

It writes to HDFS/S3/DBFS.

---

### **119. How do you test PySpark code locally before deploying to EMR?**

**Answer:**

Steps:

1. Use **`SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]")`**
2. Write **unit tests** with `pytest` or `unittest`
3. Use **mock data** with `createDataFrame()`
4. Enable **log level WARN** to reduce noise
5. Write **integration test pipeline** in local mode

Example:

```python
def test_transformation():
    spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]").appName("Test").getOrCreate()
    df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, "India")], ["id", "country"])
    result = transform(df)
    assert result.count() == 1
```

---

### **120. How do you trigger PySpark jobs via Airflow DAGs?**

**Answer:**

Use **`BashOperator`** or **`EmrAddStepsOperator`**:

Example with Bash:

```python
BashOperator(
    task_id='run_pyspark_job',
    bash_command='spark-submit /path/to/script.py',
    dag=dag
)
```

Or with EMR:

```python
EmrAddStepsOperator(
    task_id='add_steps',
    job_flow_id='{{ task_instance.xcom_pull("create_cluster") }}',
    steps=steps,
    aws_conn_id='aws_default',
    dag=dag
)
```

Can pass parameters dynamically using Jinja templating.

Awesome! Here's **Batch 13 (Q121‚Äì130)** of real-time PySpark interview questions with detailed answers:

---

### **121. What‚Äôs the difference between `persist()` and `cache()` in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Both are used to store RDD/DataFrame in memory to avoid recomputation.

* `cache()` is shorthand for `persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)`
* `persist()` gives more control over storage levels

Example:

```python
df.cache()  # stores in memory
df.persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)  # stores only on disk
```

Use `persist()` when dataset is too large to fit in memory.

---

### **122. How do you identify and resolve data skew in PySpark joins?**

**Answer:**

**Identify:**

* Monitor skewed stage in Spark UI (long tail tasks)
* Check value frequency in join keys

**Resolve:**

* **Salting technique**: Add random prefix to skewed keys
* **Broadcast join** if one side is small
* Filter/aggregate before join
* Repartition by join key

Example:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, concat
df = df.withColumn("salt", (rand() * 10).cast("int"))
df = df.withColumn("join_key_salted", concat(df.key, df.salt))
```

---

### **123. How do you handle missing or null values in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

* **Drop nulls**:

  ```python
  df.dropna()
  df.na.drop(subset=["col1"])
  ```
* **Fill with default value**:

  ```python
  df.fillna({"col1": 0, "col2": "unknown"})
  ```
* **Replace specific values**:

  ```python
  df.replace("NA", None)
  ```

You can also use `when().otherwise()` for conditional replacements.

---

### **124. What is Catalyst Optimizer in Spark?**

**Answer:**

The **Catalyst Optimizer** is Spark‚Äôs **query optimization framework**.

It applies:

* **Logical optimizations** (predicate pushdown, constant folding)
* **Physical optimizations** (join selection, code generation)
* **Rule-based transformations** for efficient execution

Benefits:

* Faster execution
* Automatic optimization
* Better performance for SQL/DataFrame APIs

---

### **125. How do you create and use Broadcast Variables in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Used to share **read-only lookup data** across all workers efficiently.

```python
broadcastVar = sc.broadcast({"IN": "India", "US": "United States"})

rdd = sc.parallelize(["IN", "US"])
rdd.map(lambda x: broadcastVar.value.get(x)).collect()
```

Reduces shuffling and memory usage for repeated lookups.

---

### **126. How do you monitor PySpark job performance?**

**Answer:**

Key Tools:

* **Spark UI** (`localhost:4040`)
* **YARN UI** for EMR/Hadoop
* **Ganglia/CloudWatch** for EMR

Check:

* Stages & tasks timeline
* Shuffle read/write
* Skewed tasks
* Memory/storage levels
* DAG visualizations

Tune using:

* Repartitioning
* Caching
* Join strategy optimization

---

### **127. What are Accumulators in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

**Accumulators** are **write-only shared variables** used for aggregations across workers (e.g., counters, sums).

```python
acc = sc.accumulator(0)
rdd.foreach(lambda x: acc.add(1))
print(acc.value)
```

Good for debugging and metrics; not suitable for returning values from tasks.

---

### **128. How do you implement Retry logic for Spark job failures in Airflow?**

**Answer:**

In `BashOperator` or `SparkSubmitOperator`, configure:

```python
BashOperator(
    task_id='spark_job',
    bash_command='spark-submit job.py',
    retries=3,
    retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5),
    dag=dag
)
```

Airflow will retry on failure after specified delay.

Also use `TriggerRule` and `on_failure_callback` for more control.

---

### **129. How do you write unit tests for PySpark code?**

**Answer:**

Use `pytest` or `unittest`.

Steps:

* Create test SparkSession with `.master("local[*]")`
* Prepare mock input DataFrame
* Run your logic
* Assert output DataFrame schema/values

Example:

```python
def test_sum():
    spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]").appName("test").getOrCreate()
    df = spark.createDataFrame([(1,2)], ["a","b"])
    result = df.withColumn("c", col("a") + col("b"))
    assert result.select("c").collect()[0][0] == 3
```

---

### **130. How do you handle real-time data ingestion from Kafka in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Use **Structured Streaming** with Kafka source:

```python
df = spark.readStream.format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "host:port") \
    .option("subscribe", "topic1") \
    .load()

df_parsed = df.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING)")
```

Then transform and write:

```python
df_parsed.writeStream \
    .format("parquet") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/chkpt/") \
    .start("/output/")
```

Supports watermarking, aggregations, windowing.

Great! Here's **Batch 14 (Q131‚Äì140)** of PySpark real-time scenario-based interview questions with detailed answers:

---

### **131. How do you debug a failing Spark job in production?**

**Answer:**

1. **Check Spark UI logs**:

   * Look for failed stages, tasks, and shuffle operations.
   * Review error stack trace from logs.

2. **Validate inputs**:

   * Are paths accessible? Files corrupted or empty?

3. **Check memory/storage**:

   * Monitor executor memory, GC logs, and data skew.

4. **Isolate the issue**:

   * Use `sample()`, test with smaller partitions.

5. **Enable logs**:

   ```python
   spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("DEBUG")
   ```

6. **Use `.explain()`** for transformation lineage and `.show()` at checkpoints.

---

### **132. Explain the role of `.explain()` and `.debug()` in PySpark.**

**Answer:**

* `.explain()` displays the **logical and physical execution plan** of a DataFrame. Helps understand Catalyst Optimizer decisions.

```python
df.select("col1").groupBy("col1").count().explain(True)
```

* `.debug()` isn't a PySpark method. For debugging, use:

  * Logs, `printSchema()`
  * Intermediate `.show()`, `.collect()`
  * `df.rdd.toDebugString()` (on RDDs)

---

### **133. How do you handle schema evolution in PySpark with sources like Snowflake or JSON?**

**Answer:**

1. **For JSON/Parquet**:

   * Use `mergeSchema=True` during read

   ```python
   spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet(path)
   ```

2. **Snowflake**:

   * Read metadata and compare with DataFrame schema
   * Dynamically create missing columns with `withColumn()`

3. **Generic approach**:

   * Maintain versioned schemas
   * Use flexible schema reads with `StructType().add()` logic

---

### **134. How do you implement Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

1. Read current dimension table and new data.
2. Join on business key.
3. Compare attribute changes.
4. For changes:

   * Expire old record (`end_date`, `is_active=False`)
   * Insert new version (`start_date`, `is_active=True`)
5. Use `union()` and write back.

Advanced:

* Use Delta Lake `MERGE INTO` or manually manage history with partitioned writes.

---

### **135. How do you automate daily Spark jobs on AWS EMR using Airflow?**

**Answer:**

* Use `EmrAddStepsOperator` and `EmrStepSensor`:

```python
EmrAddStepsOperator(
    job_flow_id='j-xxxxxxx',
    steps=[step_config],
    task_id='add_emr_steps'
)

EmrStepSensor(
    task_id='watch_step',
    job_flow_id='j-xxxxxxx',
    step_id="{{ task_instance.xcom_pull('add_emr_steps', key='return_value')[0] }}"
)
```

* Schedule DAG using cron.
* Store outputs in S3 and track checkpoints.

---

### **136. How do you manage secrets (Snowflake, PostgreSQL creds) securely in PySpark on AWS?**

**Answer:**

**Use AWS Secrets Manager**:

* Store DB creds
* Access via Boto3 in Spark job

```python
import boto3, json
sm = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
secret = json.loads(sm.get_secret_value(SecretId='my-secret')['SecretString'])
```

Avoid hardcoding. Set secrets as environment variables or pass through Airflow connections securely.

---

### **137. Describe a pipeline you built with EMR, Airflow, and PySpark.**

**Answer:**

Typical architecture:

1. Triggered daily Airflow DAG
2. `EMRCreateClusterOperator` launches EMR
3. `SparkSubmitOperator` or EMR steps run PySpark
4. Jobs read from S3/Web API, process using PySpark
5. Data written back to S3 in Parquet format
6. Cluster auto-terminated
7. Monitored using logs + CloudWatch + Slack alerts

---

### **138. How do you perform deduplication in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

* Based on a subset of columns:

```python
df.dropDuplicates(["id", "date"])
```

* Keep latest based on timestamp:

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
w = Window.partitionBy("id").orderBy(col("timestamp").desc())
df = df.withColumn("rn", row_number().over(w)).filter("rn = 1")
```

---

### **139. What are some anti-patterns in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

* Using UDFs excessively instead of built-in functions
* Collecting large data with `.collect()` or `.toPandas()`
* Writing small files ‚Üí file explosion
* Using `repartition()` blindly
* Not caching reused DataFrames
* Broadcasting large data accidentally
* Ignoring data skew and joins optimizations

---

### **140. What‚Äôs the difference between `row_number()` and `rank()` window functions?**

**Answer:**

| Function       | Description                           | Gaps in Rank? |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `row_number()` | Assigns unique incrementing number    | ‚ùå No gaps     |
| `rank()`       | Same value gets same rank, next skips | ‚úÖ Yes (1,1,3) |
| `dense_rank()` | Same value gets same rank, no skips   | ‚ùå No (1,1,2)  |

Used in deduplication, top-N filtering, and SCD logic.

Perfect! Here's **Batch 15 (Q141‚Äì150)** of PySpark real-time interview questions with detailed answers:

---

### **141. How do you optimize a PySpark job that‚Äôs taking too long on EMR?**

**Answer:**
Optimization checklist:

* **Repartition**: Avoid unnecessary shuffles, use `.repartition()` or `.coalesce()` wisely.
* **Broadcast smaller datasets** during joins:

  ```python
  broadcast(df_small)
  ```
* **Cache reused DataFrames** to avoid recomputation:

  ```python
  df.cache()
  ```
* **Avoid UDFs** where possible ‚Äî prefer Spark SQL functions.
* **Tune EMR settings**: executor memory, core count, dynamic allocation.
* **Profile using Spark UI**: detect skew, GC overhead, or failed stages.

---

### **142. What causes data skew in PySpark and how do you fix it?**

**Answer:**
**Causes**:

* One key has significantly more data than others.
* Common in joins, groupBy, or aggregations.

**Fixes**:

* **Salting**: Add random prefix to key
* **Skew join optimization**: Broadcast the smaller table
* **Custom partitioning**
* Use `approxQuantile()` to detect skew

---

### **143. How do you implement incremental data load in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

1. Identify unique timestamp or incremental ID field.
2. Store last processed value.
3. On next run, read only newer data:

   ```python
   df.filter(col("updated_at") > last_processed_time)
   ```
4. Save checkpoint or metadata (in DB/S3).
5. Append new data or upsert (merge).

---

### **144. How do you upsert (merge) data in PySpark without Delta Lake?**

**Answer:**

1. Read existing data.
2. Join with new data.
3. Separate updated, new, and unchanged rows.
4. Union the result.
5. Overwrite old partition or full table:

   ```python
   final_df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet(path)
   ```

Delta Lake makes this easier using `MERGE INTO`.

---

### **145. Explain a case when you had to deal with schema mismatch.**

**Answer:**
In one case, a schema in Snowflake changed ‚Äî a column type was altered.

**Approach**:

* Read Snowflake table schema using `DESCRIBE`.
* Cast PySpark columns accordingly.
* Add missing columns with `withColumn("col", lit(None))`.
* Used `selectExpr()` to align columns before union.

---

### **146. How do you handle late arriving data in streaming?**

**Answer:**

1. Use **Watermarking**:

   ```python
   .withWatermark("event_time", "10 minutes")
   ```

2. Use **Windowed Aggregation** to handle out-of-order events.

3. Store raw events in Bronze layer (e.g., S3) for replay if needed.

4. Retry logic on ingestion layer (Kafka, API, etc.)

---

### **147. What are some best practices for using PySpark on AWS EMR?**

**Answer:**

* Use **spot instances** + on-demand core.
* Enable **auto-scaling**.
* Store data in **S3 Parquet** with partitioning.
* Monitor with **CloudWatch + Spark UI logs**.
* Configure **bootstrap actions** for custom setup.
* Avoid small files (file explosion).
* Tune executor memory, cores, dynamic allocation.

---

### **148. How do you recover a failed stage in Spark?**

**Answer:**

* Spark retries failed stages **4 times by default**.
* If persistent failure:

  * Use logs to find corrupt input or transformation logic.
  * Retry after isolating faulty record (use `.foreach()` for granular check).
* Can recover from checkpoints (streaming).

---

### **149. Explain Catalyst Optimizer in Spark.**

**Answer:**

**Catalyst** is Spark SQL's query optimization framework. It applies:

1. **Logical plan optimization** (push filters, prune columns).
2. **Physical plan optimization** (choose join strategy, broadcast).
3. **Code generation** via **Tungsten** for better execution.

Used internally in:

* SQL queries
* DataFrame/Dataset APIs

---

### **150. What are common causes of out-of-memory errors in Spark?**

**Answer:**

* **Large shuffles** during wide transformations (join, groupBy).
* **Improper partitioning**: Too few = large partitions.
* **Broadcasting large datasets**.
* **Not caching selectively**.
* **Skewed data** overloading one executor.

**Fix**:

* Tune `spark.executor.memory`, GC settings.
* Use salting, repartitioning, broadcasting carefully.
