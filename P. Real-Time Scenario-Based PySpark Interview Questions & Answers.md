# Real-Time Scenario-Based PySpark Interview Questions & Answers

### üßë‚Äçüíª Data Ingestion & Processing

**1. How did you handle schema evolution in PySpark when reading data from Snowflake or S3?**
Schema evolution is handled using the `mergeSchema` option (for formats like Parquet). In Snowflake, we dynamically infer schema and use external metadata tables to map and adjust columns. We also write code to detect new columns and add default values during transformation.

**2. What would you do if one API out of 10 fails in a data pipeline?**
We implement try-except blocks around each API call and use logging to capture failures. Failed APIs are added to a retry queue. We also design the DAG to be idempotent so re-running only retries the failed API.

**3. How do you read large files from S3 in chunks using PySpark?**
We partition large files either by time-based folders or split them using S3 Select or pre-processing jobs. PySpark reads in parallel using `.read.format().load()` and we tune the number of partitions using `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`.

**4. Explain how you created dynamic partitioning while writing data to S3.**
We use `partitionBy("column_name")` while writing DataFrames. For dynamic partitions, we extract the partition columns at runtime based on file content.

**5. How do you validate the structure and content of incoming data files before processing?**
We implement schema validation using StructType. We validate row counts, nulls, duplicates, and date formats before transformation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è PySpark Performance Tuning

**6. How did you identify a slow PySpark job in production and what steps did you take to optimize it?**
We used Spark UI to identify long stages and wide transformations. After identifying shuffle-heavy operations, we introduced broadcast joins, tuned partition counts, and cached intermediate DataFrames.

**7. What is data skew, and how have you resolved it in your project?**
Data skew is when one key has significantly more records, leading to unbalanced tasks. We resolved it using salting, i.e., adding a random number to the skewed key to distribute data evenly.

**8. Describe a situation where repartitioning or coalescing made a difference in job performance.**
In one case, 200 partitions were generated by default, slowing down small-file writes. We used `.coalesce(20)` to reduce the overhead.

**9. Have you used broadcast joins in a production scenario? When and why?**
Yes, when joining a large dataset with a small lookup table (<10MB). Broadcasting avoided shuffle and sped up the join operation.

**10. How do you monitor Spark job performance on EMR?**
We use Spark UI, Ganglia, CloudWatch, and EMR job history logs to monitor job runtime, memory usage, GC, and failed tasks.

---

### üíß PySpark Transformations & ETL Logic

**11. How did you implement complex joins and aggregations in PySpark efficiently?**
We used broadcast joins where applicable, cached intermediate DataFrames, and ensured columns were indexed properly using `.select()` to reduce shuffles.

**12. Explain a real-life use case where you had to unnest deeply nested JSON.**
We processed REST API responses with nested arrays. We used `explode()` and `withColumn()` to flatten nested structures and extracted key-value pairs recursively.

**13. How did you create a PySpark pipeline to process data from multiple sources like APIs and databases?**
We used Python requests to pull from APIs, JDBC to read from DBs, and Spark transformations to normalize and merge the data.

**14. Share a scenario where you used window functions to solve a business problem.**
In a churn analysis, we used `row_number()` to rank the latest transactions per customer and `lag()` to compare activities across time.

**15. How do you track and handle duplicate records during ETL processing?**
We use `dropDuplicates()` or window functions with `row_number()` to retain the latest record. We also log duplicates for analysis.

---

### üß† Error Handling & Debugging

**16. What kind of exceptions have you commonly faced in PySpark jobs and how did you fix them?**
Common errors include schema mismatches, null pointer exceptions, and out-of-memory errors. We add extensive logging, null checks, and use `try-except` blocks.

**17. How do you implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs in Airflow?**
We configure retries in DAG definition (`retries=3`, `retry_delay=5min`). We also use alerting with Slack/Email.

**18. Share a scenario where Spark UI helped you debug a failing job.**
In one job, long GC times were visible in Spark UI. We increased executor memory and tuned GC settings to fix it.

**19. How do you capture bad records or corrupt files while reading large datasets?**
We use `badRecordsPath` for CSV/JSON and parse data in try-except blocks for custom formats. Invalid records are logged separately.

**20. What are some logging strategies you follow for PySpark code in production?**
We use `log4j` for structured logging and external logging tools like CloudWatch. Logs are structured with job ID, step name, and timestamp.

# Real-Time PySpark Interview Scenarios and Answers

---

### **21. How do you handle schema evolution in PySpark when reading from a data source like Parquet or Snowflake?**

**Answer:** PySpark allows schema evolution using options like `mergeSchema` when reading Parquet files. For example:

```python
spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("path")
```

For Snowflake, we often retrieve the latest schema by querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and dynamically constructing a DataFrame schema. Alternatively, we use Delta Lake with schema evolution enabled.

---

### **22. Describe a situation where you had to optimize a PySpark job. What steps did you take?**

**Answer:** In a previous project, we had long-running Spark jobs due to skewed joins and large shuffles. To optimize:

* Applied **salting** to distribute keys.
* Used **broadcast joins** where possible.
* Repartitioned RDDs before shuffle-heavy operations.
* Cached intermediate results that were reused.

---

### **23. How do you manage job failures and retries in a PySpark + Airflow pipeline?**

**Answer:**

* We configure retries using `retries` and `retry_delay` in Airflow DAGs.

**Answer:**

* Maintain environment-specific YAML or JSON config files.
* Load them dynamically in Spark scripts.
* Use environment variables via `os.environ` or Airflow `Variables`.
* Also use `SecretsManager` for credentials in AWS-based environments.

---

### **27. Give an example of how you dealt with skewed data in PySpark joins.**

**Answer:**

* Identified skew using key distribution metrics.
* Introduced **salting**: modified keys on one side (e.g., add random suffix) and exploded keys on the other side to match.
* Used **broadcast joins** if one table was small.
* Applied `repartition()` before the join to ensure better distribution.

---

### **28. What is your approach when your PySpark job is consuming too much memory?**

**Answer:**

* Repartitioned data to reduce size per partition.
* Used narrow transformations instead of wide ones.
* Tuned `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.cores`, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.
* Used `persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)` to offload from memory.

---

### **29. How do you handle late arriving data or backfills in a streaming pipeline?**

**Answer:**

* Used **watermarking** with event time in Structured Streaming:

```python
.withWatermark("event_time", "1 hour")
```

* Handled late events in downstream logic.
* For backfills, triggered batch jobs with past data range and separate S3 path.

---

### **30. Describe a scenario where you needed to ensure idempotency in your PySpark job.**

**Answer:**

* Idempotency was critical while writing output to S3 or Snowflake.
* Achieved it by using `overwrite` mode and **partitioned output** (e.g., by date).
* Used job run identifiers or timestamps to separate directories.
* Maintained audit logs in a control table to track processed data.

### **31. How do you handle missing or null values in PySpark DataFrames?**

**Answer:**

Handling nulls depends on context:

* **Drop rows with nulls:**

  ```python
  df.na.drop()
  ```

  Options:

  * `df.na.drop(how="any")` ‚Äì drop if any column has null
  * `df.na.drop(how="all")` ‚Äì drop only if all columns are null

* **Fill nulls with default values:**

  ```python
  df.na.fill({"age": 0, "name": "unknown"})
  ```

* **Filter out nulls explicitly:**

  ```python
  df.filter(df["age"].isNotNull())
  ```

Use method based on business logic (e.g., for ML pipelines, fill with mean/median using `imputer`).

---

### **32. How do you optimize PySpark joins in real-time pipelines?**

**Answer:**

Optimization techniques:

* **Broadcast smaller table:**

  ```python
  from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
  df1.join(broadcast(df2), "id")
  ```

* **Repartition by join key to reduce shuffle:**

  ```python
  df1.repartition("id").join(df2.repartition("id"), "id")
  ```

* **Avoid skewed joins (use salting):** Add/mod hash key to balance partition sizes.

* **Use appropriate join type (e.g., avoid full outer joins unless necessary).**

* Enable join hints if supported:

  ```python
  df1.join(df2.hint("broadcast"), "id")
  ```

---

### **33. How do you debug job failure in EMR while running a PySpark job?**

**Answer:**

Steps:

* **Check Spark UI:** Look for stages, DAGs, and failed task logs.
* **Review EMR logs in S3:** EMR logs go to `s3://<log-bucket>/logs/`.
* **Enable detailed logs:**

  * Set `spark.eventLog.enabled=true`
  * Use `log4j.properties` for custom logging
* **Common errors:**

  * OutOfMemory ‚Üí tweak executor memory
  * Data Skew ‚Üí salting
  * Missing files/schemas ‚Üí validate paths and schema before execution

---

### **34. What is the use of `.persist()` vs `.cache()` in a real job?**

**Answer:**

* `.cache()` is a shortcut for `.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)`.
* Use **`.persist()`** when you want control over storage level (e.g., disk-only, off-heap).
* Use **`.cache()`** when RDD/DataFrame is used multiple times and fits in memory.
* Helps in iterative algorithms (ML, graph).

```python
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
```

---

### **35. How do you test PySpark code locally before deployment?**

**Answer:**

* Use **`local[*]` mode** for SparkSession:

  ```python
  spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local[*]").appName("test").getOrCreate()
  ```

* Use **pytest** or **unittest** with:

  * Temporary DataFrames
  * Sample input files in `/tmp`
  * Mocking APIs/snowflake with `responses` or test doubles

* Leverage `.collect()` and `.show()` for validation

---

### **36. How do you manage schema evolution in real-time pipelines (e.g., Snowflake source)?**

**Answer:**

* Use **schema inference** carefully ‚Äî schema drift can break ETL.
* Strategy:

  * Read schema separately via sampling
  * Validate new schema using `.schema.json()`
  * Write schema comparison logic
  * Add new columns as nullable or handle using `selectExpr` with `IF EXISTS`

Tools:

* Delta Lake schema evolution (`mergeSchema`)
* Glue Schema Registry for tracking

---

### **37. Have you implemented dynamic partitioning in PySpark? How?**

**Answer:**

Yes. To enable dynamic partitioning:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode", "dynamic")
df.write.partitionBy("year", "month").mode("overwrite").parquet("s3://bucket/output/")
```

* It partitions by `year` and `month` dynamically
* Helps reduce scan space for queries (e.g., Athena, Hive)

---

### **38. How do you integrate external APIs into your PySpark job?**

**Answer:**

* Use Python‚Äôs `requests` or `httpx` inside UDFs **with caution** (not recommended for heavy API calls).

Best practice:

* **Extract API data separately** via:

  * Standalone Python script using `requests`
  * Save API data as JSON/CSV to S3
  * Ingest using PySpark `spark.read.json("s3://...")`

Reason:

* Spark isn‚Äôt meant for row-wise API I/O ‚Äì it slows down massively.

---

### **39. What‚Äôs your approach to version-controlling PySpark jobs?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Git** to maintain:

  * PySpark job scripts
  * Config files (YAML/JSON for param settings)
  * Airflow DAGs
* Use branches for feature and hotfixes
* Enforce PRs with code review
* Use `.gitignore` for logs, `__pycache__`, temp data
* Store job artifacts (egg/whl) for CI/CD pipelines

---

### **40. How do you monitor your PySpark jobs in production?**

**Answer:**

* **Monitoring Tools:**

  * **Spark UI** for execution details
  * **CloudWatch (AWS)** for EMR cluster resource metrics
  * **Ganglia** / **Prometheus + Grafana**
  * **Airflow UI** for DAG and task status
* Log all:

  * Data stats (record count, nulls)
  * Execution time
  * Error stack traces

Use logging libraries:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

### **41. How do you handle large file ingestion (100+ GB) efficiently in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Handling large files in PySpark:

* **Use partitioning:**

  ```python
  df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv("s3://bucket/largefile/", multiLine=True)
  df = df.repartition(100)
  ```

  Increases parallelism and reduces shuffle.

* **Use appropriate file format:** Prefer **Parquet** or **ORC** over CSV/JSON for columnar compression.

* **Enable predicate pushdown**:

  ```python
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown", "true")
  ```

* **Tune Spark config:** Use `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.

---

### **42. What are common causes of memory issues in PySpark jobs?**

**Answer:**

* **Too much data in a single partition** (data skew)
* **Caching huge DataFrames** without enough memory
* **Improper joins** (e.g., wide join + no broadcast)
* **Expensive UDFs** that create high GC overhead
* **No checkpointing** in iterative jobs (e.g., ML)
* **Unbounded data growth** due to unfiltered joins or aggregations

**Fixes:**

* Repartition/coalesce
* Use broadcast join
* Avoid unnecessary `.collect()` or `.cache()`
* Increase executor memory or use auto-scaling on EMR

---

### **43. Explain your deployment process for PySpark jobs.**

**Answer:**

Typical deployment steps:

1. **Code pushed to Git**
2. **CI/CD via Jenkins/GitHub Actions:**

   * Code linting & testing
   * Build `egg` or `whl` packages
3. **Deploy on EMR using Airflow DAG**:

   * BashOperator or EMROperator triggers job
   * Logs stored in CloudWatch/S3
4. **Monitoring:** Slack/email alerts on failure

---

### **44. How do you implement SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Two types handled commonly:

* **SCD Type 1 (overwrite):**

  * Just overwrite old record with new

  ```python
  df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("dim_table")
  ```

* **SCD Type 2 (history tracking):**

  * Add new record with `current_flag`, `effective_date`, `expiry_date`
  * Use `window` and `when` to close old records:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.window import Window
    from pyspark.sql.functions import when, col, lead

    w = Window.partitionBy("id").orderBy("effective_date")
    df = df.withColumn("expiry_date", lead("effective_date").over(w))
    ```

---

### **45. How do you build reusable code for PySpark projects?**

**Answer:**

* **Modular functions** for cleaning, transformation, loading

* Store in Python files/modules

* Example:

  ```python
  # transformations.py
  def clean_names(df):
      return df.withColumn("name", upper(col("name")))
  ```

* Import in jobs:

  ```python
  from transformations import clean_names
  ```

* Store configs in YAML/JSON and parse in jobs

---

### **46. How do you secure secrets (like API keys or DB credentials) in PySpark workflows?**

**Answer:**

Best practices:

* **Use AWS Secrets Manager** or environment variables
* Use Airflow‚Äôs `Variable` or `Connections` feature
* Avoid hardcoding in scripts

Example:

```python
import boto3, json
secrets = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
secret_val = secrets.get_secret_value(SecretId="snowflake_conn")["SecretString"]
credentials = json.loads(secret_val)
```

---

### **47. How do you perform job retries for failures in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

Two ways:

* **Within PySpark using try-except + retry logic:**

  ```python
  for _ in range(3):
      try:
          run_my_job()
          break
      except Exception as e:
          print("Retrying...", e)
  ```

* **External orchestration tools (Airflow)**: Use `retries` parameter:

  ```python
  BashOperator(task_id='spark_job', retries=3, retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5))
  ```

---

### **48. Explain how you handled schema mismatch while reading data.**

**Answer:**

Schema mismatch scenarios:

* **Extra/missing columns:** Use `schema` parameter to enforce expected structure
* **Different column types:** Use `cast()` or `selectExpr()`

Preventive approach:

```python
schema = StructType([...])
df = spark.read.schema(schema).csv("path")
```

Use `badRecordsPath` to isolate failures:

```python
.option("badRecordsPath", "s3://bucket/badrecords/")
```

---

* Custom `logging` module for capturing detailed logs

---

### **50. What steps do you take before promoting a PySpark job to production?**

**Answer:**

Checklist:

1. **Unit tested logic** (pytest/unittest)
2. **Run on lower env (dev/staging)** with test data
3. **Validate performance and memory use**
4. **Setup alerts** for failures (email, Slack)
5. **Code review and approval**
6. **Use parameterized configs**
7. **Ensure versioning and rollback plan**
