# ✅ **Batch 11: Airflow, Testing, and Deployment (101–110)**

---

### **101. How do you trigger PySpark scripts using Airflow?**

**Answer:**

You can use `BashOperator` or `PythonOperator` to trigger PySpark scripts.

**BashOperator Example:**

```python
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator

run_pyspark = BashOperator(
    task_id='run_etl_job',
    bash_command='spark-submit /path/to/etl_script.py',
    dag=dag
)
```

**PythonOperator (indirect execution):**

```python
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def run_spark():
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["spark-submit", "etl_script.py"])

run_task = PythonOperator(task_id='run', python_callable=run_spark, dag=dag)
```

---

### **102. What are EMR Operators in Airflow?**

**Answer:**

Airflow provides **pre-built operators** to interact with AWS EMR:

* `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator`
* `EmrAddStepsOperator`
* `EmrTerminateJobFlowOperator`

These help you:

* Create EMR clusters
* Add Spark steps
* Monitor EMR job lifecycle
* Terminate clusters after use

Example:

```python
EmrAddStepsOperator(
    task_id='add_steps',
    job_flow_id='{{ task_instance.xcom_pull("create_emr") }}',
    steps=[...],
    aws_conn_id='aws_default'
)
```

---

### **103. How do you structure DAGs for large PySpark workflows?**

**Answer:**

Best practices for DAG structuring:

* Use **modular tasks** (one for extraction, one for transformation, etc.)
* Use **XCom** to pass small metadata between tasks
* Separate **cluster provisioning** and **job execution**
* Add **notifications** and **fail-safes**
* Parameterize with `Variable.get()`

---

### **104. How do you test PySpark code?**

**Answer:**

Use standard Python frameworks like `pytest` or `unittest` and initialize a **SparkSession** in your tests.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local").appName("Test").getOrCreate()

def test_filter_logic():
    df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, "A"), (2, "B")], ["id", "val"])
    result = df.filter("id > 1")
    assert result.count() == 1
```

Mocking and fixtures can improve test isolation.

---

### **105. How to debug PySpark jobs?**

**Answer:**

* Use `.explain()` to inspect the physical and logical plan.
* Enable detailed logging (`INFO`, `DEBUG`).
* Check **Spark UI** at `localhost:4040` (for local) or EMR cluster URL.
* Use try/except blocks and log exceptions.
* Use **sample data** in local mode (`local[*]`) for iterative debugging.

| Control  | No config    | Allows `StorageLevel` control     |
| Use-case | Simple reuse | Complex data reuse scenarios      |

```python
df.cache()
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
```

---

### **107. What is the `.explain()` method in PySpark?**

**Answer:**

It shows **execution plans** for DataFrames or SQL queries.

```python
df.explain(True)
```

* **Logical Plan** → Transformation lineage

Used to debug performance bottlenecks.

---

### **108. How do you handle logging in PySpark applications?**

**Answer:**

* Use Python’s `logging` module
* Configure Spark logs via `log4j.properties`
* Store logs in **S3 / CloudWatch** in EMR jobs
* Structure logs for tools like **ELK** stack

Example:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
log = logging.getLogger("my_etl")
log.info("Starting job...")
```

---

### **109. How do you deploy PySpark projects using CI/CD?**

**Answer:**

Pipeline steps:

1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. Jenkins/GitHub Actions triggered
3. Run unit tests with Pytest
4. Package code into `.zip` or `.egg`
5. Upload to S3 or deploy to EMR/Lambda
6. Trigger Airflow DAG or EMR job

Tools used:

* Docker (optional)
* AWS CLI / EMR Step APIs

---

### **110. What’s the typical folder structure for a PySpark project?**

  ```
* Use **partitioning** before join (if keys are skewed)
* Avoid **wide transformations** in the same stage
* Optimize skewed data using **salting**
* Choose the correct **join type** (inner, semi, etc.)

---

### **114. What is data skew and how do you fix it?**

**Answer:**

**Data skew** happens when one or more keys have significantly more data, leading to long-running tasks.

Fixes include:

* **Salting keys** – Add a random suffix and repartition
